# Conclusion

Congratulations! You experienced version control:

* Proposing changes within a short lived feature branch
* Submit a pull request
* Looked for feedback with a peer review
* Iterate on the change
* Merge the change in the `master` branch

This process is appropriate for a small team, and can also scale for very large
teams. Remember, this process is applicable to application code, but also documentation, infrastructure, and any type of text based asset.
