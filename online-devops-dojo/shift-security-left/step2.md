To proceed with this lab you need to have your own copy of the Pet Clinic GitHub repository under your GitHub user name. If you have not done so please take the Welcome module.

Then run the following command to bring up Jenkins and connect it to your copy of the Pet Clinic application's code. This script may take a few minutes to run.

**Note**: you will re-use GitHub's "Personal Access Token" you have created in the Welcome module. If you need to generate a new one, go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and save it for later.

Let's go ahead and prepare our environment, click this:

 `./prepare.sh`{{execute}}

answer the question and wait for the "Click on 'CONTINUE'" message.
